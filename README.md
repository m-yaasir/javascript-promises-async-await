npm install

## Running Tests

Run tests using the command:

```

Verify Setup

To ensure everything runs correctly, we can run the tests:

npm run test

We should see failing tests in the output. As we progress through the project, we'll gradually work towards all of the tests passing. Run npm run test at any time to check your work locally.

## To verify your work locally 

npm run test:moduleX


## Running the project

Previewing Your Work

To run the application, use the following command:

npm start

You can then in your browser go to http://localhost:1234, open up your browser's console, and see the code working. Initially, not much will happen, but you will see more once you have completed all tasks.



To run the project:

```bash
npm run start
```
